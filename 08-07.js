//promises
//what is promise?they are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
//a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
//a promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
//a promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function as an argument. This function is called the executor function.
//the executor function takes two arguments: resolve and reject. The resolve function is called when the asynchronous operation is successful, and the reject function is called when the asynchronous operation fails.
//the Promise constructor returns a promise object, which can be used to handle the result of the asynchronous operation.
//the then() method is used to handle the result of the promise when it is fulfilled,   and the catch() method is used to handle the result of the promise when it is rejected.
